    "## Introduction to Python dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are one of the most useful object types in Python. They provide a mapping between (`key`, `value`) pairs, and represent a fast and efficient way of creating look-up tables. A simple example use for a dictionary would be something like mapping names to phone numbers or addresses. In biology, you might map sample names to a measurement. Using the dictionary we could then query a `key` (e.g., a sample name) and it will return the `value` associated with that key (e.g., the measurement). \n",
    "\n",
    "While the idea of \"looking up\" the value associated with a key might sound slow, in the realm of computational operations, it turns out that under certain designs it can be one of the fastest things possible in a language. Python uses a method called \"hashing\" to store the value associated with a key. This is the same approach it uses when you create *any* variable in Python and ask to retrieve its value. For this reason, storing and retrieving information from dictionaries is actually one of the fastest and most efficient methods to use in Python. Much faster than using lists to store and retrieve data, for example. Once you master dictionaries you'll find yourself using them all the time. "

    "### Hashing and speed\n",
    "The Python documentation on dictionaries has an aside about `hashtables`. The details of this are fascinating, but fairly dense reading, and I would say that it is not fully necessary to understand hashtables in order to understand Python programming. Nevertheless, a cursory understanding of the concept of hashing can be useful for understanding why Python `set` and `dictionary` objects are so fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main concept is that they store elements as a `hashed` value for lookup. This simply means that they use the function `hash()` to convert the element to an integer. This makes it easy to compare whether two elements are the same by simply asking whether the integer is the same. \n"
