This means that the objects have a built-in structure that allows us to easily look at each of their individual data points in order. \n",

In Python we represent this information using indentation. The indentation of one tab in the line under the `for loop` clause indicates to Python that this line should be repeated in each iteration of the loop. Everything on additional lines below that would also be repeated in each iteration of the loop, until the indentation expands back out."

    "### The `range` and `len` functions \n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence object `range` is a special highly efficient operator for iterating over numeric values. It has the form `range(start, stop, step)`, and returns an object that generates numbers on the fly as they are sampled. This makes it highly efficient since if you tell it to generate a billion numbers it doesn't need to generate them ahead of time but instead generates them only as they are needed. `range` is important since it is often used in conjunction with sequence type objects to sample their index. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful function that is often used it tandem with `range` is the function `len`, which stands for *length*. It is used to measure the length of an iterable object, meaning it will tell you how many elements are inside of it. One way that these two functions are combined is to ask `range` to return a sequence of integers that is the same length as an iterable object. This will allow you to iterate over the entire index of an iterable object. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below we iterate over every element in dna by calling `len(dna)` which returns an integer and wrapping that inside of range which returns a sequence for that entire length. "
